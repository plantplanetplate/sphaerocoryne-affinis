## Introduction 
While walking through almost any temple, public park, or decorated hotel garden across Cambodia, a branch of flowering golden Sphaerocoryne affinis or the Rumdul (រំដួល) is bound to capture your attention. Its uniquely enchanting scent of musky and sweet is often described as a defining characteristic of the experience of a late afternoon or early evening in Cambodia, as these are its peak blooming moments of the day. Such smells easily cling and disperse across the winds, making it very likely to be able to smell Rumdul before even seeing one of its petite blooms. This fragrance, coupled with the triangular symmetry of its flower petals, makes it a memorable highlight for both locals and visitors alike. Its status as the national flower of Cambodia is unsurprising – it’s hard to think of examples of a more beloved flower. While only designated as a national symbol in 2005 by <span ve-entity title="King Norodom Sihamoni" eid="Q57319">King Norodom Sihamoni</span> via royal decree, the cultural significance of the flower is longstanding – one only needs to visit remnants of <span ve-entity title="Angkor Wat" eid="Q43473">Angkor Wat</span>.[^1] Amongst the temple’s numerous stone carvings, countless artistic depictions of the flower, in varying stages of growth, can be made out. From its presence within minor details like decorations on the skirts of <span ve-entity title="Aspara" eid="Q148773">Apsara</span> or forming ornate borders along walls, to entirely dedicated panels, Rumdul is undoubtedly an important Cambodian plant.

## Botanical Name(s)

Though the plant retains its naming consistency in Khmer as រំដួល (Rumdul), there have been variations in its English romanization as well as its scientific naming. There are many reasons for this, including conflicting <span ve-entity title="botanical names" eid="Q281801">botanical names</span> and the diversity of the <span ve-entity title="romanization" eid="Q976327">romanization</span> process for Khmer language. Depending on who is preparing the <span ve-entity title="transliteration" eid="Q134550">transliteration</span>, the plant’s name has changed considerably in English. Cursory online searches for “Rumdul”, “Rumdoul”, “Rumdoul”, “Romdoul”, “Romduol”, “Rum Dourl” and “Romdol” seemingly all lead to the same materials, demonstrating the extent of this English romanization issue across online sources and content. This issue also seen in the naming inconsistencies of several places in Cambodia which are named after this plant, such as “Rumdul District” in the southeastern province of  <span ve-entity title="Svay Rieng" eid="Q751864">Svay Rieng</span> (ស្វាយរៀង Svay Riĕng) or “Ou Rumdul” (ឃុំអូររំដួល) commune in the northwestern province of <span ve-entity title="Battambang" eid="Q810923">Battambang</span> (បាត់ដំបង Bătdâmbâng). While the name remains consistent in Khmer, several online mapping programs as well as travel and hospitality materials contrast.  


Rumdul is typically referred to scientifically as Sphaerocoryne affinis, though it has several synonyms. Its  <span ve-entity title="homotypic synonym" eid="Q42310380">homotypic synonym</span> is Polyalthia affinis, while its <span ve-entity title="heterotypic synonyms" eid="Q59511375">heterotypic synonyms</span> include: Dasymaschalon scandens Merr., Melodorum aberrans, Mitrella aberrans, Mitrella mesnyi, Popowia aberrans, Monsoon submitratum Miq., Polyalthia aberrans, Sphaerocoryne aberrans, and Unona mesnyi. [^2] [^3] [^4] Among these many names, several botanical signs which demarcate the plants’ growth in the Royal Palace Park in Phnom Penh, refer to them as strictly Popowia aberrans.[^5]

## Morphology 

Sphaerocoryne affinis is an <span ve-entity title="angiosperm" eid="Q25314">angiosperm</span> or flowering plant belonging to the genus Sphaerocoryne within the family Annonaceae (Soursop family).   It is a mid-size tree which can grow from 8 to 15 meters tall, with yellow-brown bark.  However, in contrast, the Kew Royal Botanical Gardens notes that this species is considered a <span ve-entity title="liana" eid="Q14079">liana</span>, or long-stem woody vine, according to earlier botanical sources.[^3] More informal sources such as gardener’s groups and flower enthusiasts have also occasionally confused Rumdul as other species altogether. For instance, because of the reputation of its fragrance, some have misidentified the flowers as a type of local “Cambodian rose”.[^6] 

The tree has  long flat singular silvery-green leaves, which have quite prominent mid-veins and are alternatively arranged without any spurs. The size of these leaves vary between two to four centimeters wide and six to ten centimeters long. Its flowers have a variable colouring of white, pale yellow, to orangey red colourings and a generally waxy appearance. Each flower has two sets of petals, three which curve inwards forming a spherical blossom, and three which stretch outwards along its perimeter, boasting a symmetrical design. The stems have a diameter of 20 to 30 centimeters. It takes anywhere from two to four years to bloom and bear fruit. These dark-red to black fruits grow in bunches and have a dusty grape pruinescence, which are edible. Each fruit is about 10 to 12 millimeters wide, starting off green and darkening with maturation. The native range for this species stretches across the wet tropical biomes of the Thai peninsula towards West-to-Central Malesia, such as in Thailand, Borneo, Jawa, Malaya, and Philippines. It is also found in nature growing in semi-dense and secondary vegetation within plain areas in Cambodia, Laos and Southern Vietnam. However, its dispersion is quite vast and it can also be found in semi-rainforest and mountainous areas of Cambodia.  While recent assessments label the species as not under threat of extinction, its status as an angiosperm within a region facing rapid biodiversity loss from pollution, deforestation, and climate change impacts, still makes it worthy of active preservation and protection.

## Medicinal Qualities

Sphaerocoryne affinis also has several healing and therapeutic effects. Since the 1990s, the plant has been extensively studied for its anti-cancer abilities (Le-Trung et al. 2023). Several parts of the plant, such as its leaves, roots, stems, bark, and flowers have demonstrated cytotoxic effects against various types of cells which contribute towards the lung, breast, cervical,  colon, and skin cancers. This means that chemicals within these different parts of the plant actively kill different types of cancer cells, when they are exposed to them. Specifically, these cancer cell lines include but are not limited to: A549 (lung carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast carcinoma), HT-29 (colon adenocarcinoma), SK-MEL-5, and Malme-3 M (melanoma). Additionally, the water extracted from the plant’s fruit is known to have high antioxidant capacity because of its high levels of ascorbic acid and phenolic compounds. For this reason, researchers have also argued that it has high potential for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. This is especially crucial because most treatments for the disease only focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life; researchers are optimistic that further research into Rumdul could lead to new medicines which could cure it altogether, making it important to matters of global health for aging populations. Within Traditional Khmer Medicine (TKM) the plant is used to treat a variety of health issues. The bark is used to treat animal bites, venomous snake bites, and is considered a fever reducer. The flowers can be used to manage blood pressure, ease bouts of dizziness, and as a preventative measure against heart attacks. 
The leaves and stems are steeped within a hot water decoction as a postpartum medicine. Like most TKM medicines for postpartum, it is potentially used in order to heat up and restore the humors after giving birth, promote recovery, or increase breastmilk production.

## Food

Rumdul is primarily sought for its fruits. The taste of Rumdul fruits is variable depending on the stage of growth, with younger fruits being more sour and the older being characteristically sweeter.  Within Cambodia, the gathering and selling of these fruits in local markets is a common means of income, during the prime growing months of December to March. In neighbouring Vietnam, Rumdul fruits are often made into either juices or non distilled alcoholic beverages. In addition to being eaten by humans, the fruits are also documented as a stable food source for local wildlife, such as birds.  Within the global jasmine rice market, a Cambodian-grown variety called called “Pk’aa Rumdul” (Rumdul Flower) has won numerous awards and is widely consumed across the country. This variety of rice is growth primarily in the provinces of Phnom Penh, Battambang, and Takeo.

## Possible Meanings and Symbolisms
Aside from being the national flower of Cambodia, Rumdul is also used in several logos for public and private entities in various sectors across the country. Not only is it commonly used in ecotourism and hospitality overall, it is also widely considered a governmental symbol of environmental preservation and protection. Within several promotional materials within the Cambodian tourist sector, various agencies have linked qualities about the plant to generalisations about the collective character of Cambodians as a whole. Some descriptors include “cheerful”, “energetic”, “positive”, “friendly”, “full of life”, and “elegant”. Despite use in several religiously-oriented Khmer cultural heritage and practices, Rumdul does not have any notable significance nor connotations in either Buddhism or Hinduism. Rumdul has also been used as a slang term to refer to a beautiful Khmer woman – with many songs, poems, and artistic creations across history demonstrating this. As a result, it is also a popular women’s name in Cambodia.

## Other Uses and Practices 

### Beauty:
Because of its exceptional fragrance, Rumdul has had a historical role and presence within cosmetic making. The flowers have been used to make both essential oils and aromatherapy oils. These extracts have been historically blended to create scented lip wax called Kramuon Rumdul, which was predominantly used by Khmer women during ancient times. The flowers were also regularly woven into women’s hairstyles, leading to an historical association with Khmer women and the flower. In the temples of Angkor Wat and Banteay Srei in Siem Reap Province, it is possible to see live carvings of Apsara and other feminine deities in ancient Khmer culture, decorated in the flowers. To this day, many Cambodian jewelry artisans include Rumdul motifs into their floral-themed designs, as marketing trends and consumer habits often link the flower to “Cambodian feminine charm”.  

### Religion:
Though there are many flowers associated with Buddhism and Hinduism, the role of the Rumdul flowers in Cambodia are primarily tied to providing offerings and receiving blessings. Around temple settings, you are bound to find merchants who are selling Rumdul flowers woven into bracelets using red thread, as well as layered bunches to leave at altars and shrines. The threading of the flowers into decorative body chains was initially a very common practice for women prior to entering temples – doing so would prompt, if not secure, a blessing. 

### Materials & Crafting: 
The wood of Rumdul is used for building furniture and homes, boats, and other useful tools. In the past, it was also used to craft weapons such as hunting bows. The wood is also used as firewood for heating, cooking, and other daily activities.

## The Arts 

### Poetry: 
In the epic poem Reamker, the Khmer literary adaptation of the Indian epic Ramayana, the story of an exiled prince’s return from a forest to claim his throne unfolds. Among his many adventures and encounters, there are references to incredibly fragrant flowers with notable symmetry and fruits, which some argue could possibly be  Rumdul, but this is still an ongoing debate. 


>Death to fruit and flower:
Leaf and blossom dropped, shriveled

>Flowers sprang up far and wide
Suddenly, richly displayed,
As if by an arranger’s art

>The flowers fluttered out their fund
Of perfume, which unwound
Sweetness pervading all the scene

Being such an important relic in Khmer literature, Reamker has been transformed to many different mediums and formats including theatrical performance, songs, and also into detailed murals. In the Silver Pagoda in Phnom Penh, there is a large mural depicting a scene where a seemingly royal, traveling entourage makes its way across the landscape. Visible on the decorated banners of some of the travelers, are golden flowers with a spherical centered blossom, and thick curved petals, similar to  those of Rumdul. 

### Dance: 
Within Cambodian ceremonial dances, Rumdul flowers are often used in combination with other fragrant, culturally significant flowers such as jasmine or lotuses within choreography. In the dance Robam Chuon Por (the blessing dance), which was upheld under Queen Sisowath Kossamak and her court, distinguished guests are greeted with Khmer dancers dressed as Aspara. In groups of three, five, or seven, the dancers hold golden goblets with water and Rumdul, jasmine, and rose flowers. With their fingers, the Apsara disperse blessed droplets towards guests, mimicking rainfall. In the past, this dance was restricted to royal courts as a method of protection and sanctification of the royal kingdom against evil spirits. However, nowadays the dance is used for wedding celebrations, political welcoming ceremonies for visitors, and opening ceremonies in Cambodia and within diaspora communities. 

### Music:
A romantic ballad by legendary Cambodian singer Sinn Sisamouth is called “Rumdul Pursat”. Within the song, he sings yearningly about a beautiful woman from Pursat province. 

>A single rumdul I have wanted
Whose name is engraved in my heart
The one I will always remember
A rumdul bloom that I love

>Flower in bloom, fragrance everywhere
All my chances ended up in sorrow
My heart is battered down by dejection
All because rumdul refuses to acknowledge my feelings 

>Rumdul Pursat, a blossom love
Despite my attempts, she remains indifferent
Perhaps Rumdul has already found her partner
Tell me, do not leave me guessing

Sinn Sisamouth also song of a similar vein, once again linking to the Rumdul flower called “Bopha Kors Rumdul” (បុប្ផាកោះរំដួល). Another famous romance ballad of similar nature is “Romduol Kratie” (រំដួលក្រចេះ) which has been sung by many Cambodian singers over the years such as Im Song Seoum (អឹុមសុងសឺម) and Duong Viraksith (ដួង វីរៈសិទ្ធ).

## Controversies
While several historical artifacts as well as recent fashion trends have demonstrated the cultural impact of Rumdul in Cambodia, there have also been some unusual controversies and claims made. In 2023, a Cambodian company named “EBook Cambodia” posted on social media a picture of a Louis Vutton handbag next to an Apsara statue carving, speculating that in actuality  the luxury brand derived its iconic design from the Rumdul flower. While the two profiles of the carving and brand icon share similarities, this rumor was quickly debunked by social media users, who cited that the icon designer Georges Vutton attributed the icon’s inspiration to be from Japanese square floral motifs.

## Growing Your Own

Given Rumdul’s wide range of uses and ornamental value, it is common for people to purchase and cultivate their own plants. Depending on your location and the availability of access to seeds, successfully growing and maintaining Rumdul may be possible. Given its native range, the climate which is most preferable for the plant has a temperature range above 20 degrees Celsius. Ideally, you should plant it in soil which is well-draining and rich in organic matter; consider incorporating organic compost or a slow-release fertiliser throughout the growing process. Though Rumdul thrives in full sun to partial shade, this might not be ideal in extremely hot climates and considerations for afternoon shading should be made. Maintaining a consistent watering schedule is important, though the plant can occasionally withstand bouts of drought. Being a tropical plant, pests such as aphids and mealybugs may appear – so be on the lookout and manage them with organic interventions only. As always, be sure to check your local rules and legislation regarding the planting and incorporation of non-native species into your garden and local ecosystem before doing so.
